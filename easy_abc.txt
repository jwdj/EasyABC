Programmer's guide to easy_abc.py

Ignoring all the support scripts, easy_abc.py is already over 5000 lines
long, so finding one's way around is not easy.

Three python programs were found very useful for exploring easy_abc.py and
related source code. 1) there is the wxPython Widget inspection tool
which is already built into wxPython. It is described in 
http://wiki.wxpython.org/Widget%20Inspection%20Tool
2) The Python Programmer's Editor - PyPE is useful for navigating
about the code. You can find it on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pype/
3) Finally the Winpdb - Cross Platform Python Debugger 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpdb/?source=directory
was also found handy.

Widgets
-------

First we shall look at the WxPython widgets in easy_abc.
When you start the program, the MainFrame window contains at
least 6 widgets. They are
StatusBar (status_line)
AuiToolBar (control)
FlexibleListCtrl (listCtrl)
StyledTextCtrl (stcwindow)
MusicScorePanel (panel)
and TextCtrl (text)
The type of wx widget is given in parentheses.

The StatusBar is the horizontal bar at the bottom of the EasyABC frame
which contains important messages. Most of the time it is blank.

Below the AuiToolBar, there frame is split into a left and right half.
The left half contains the FlexibleListCtrl which is used to list all
the tunes in the open abc file. The right half is split into the upper
and lower frames. The upper frame is the MusicScorePanel and is where
the music score is displayed. The lower frame is the StyledTextCtrl and
is where the contents of the open abc file can be edited.

The AuiToolBar is the set of controls for playing, stopping, record, 
ornamentation, dynamics, direction, and Zoom, which appear on a
horizontal bar near the top of the EasyABC frame. This widget
is a container for many other widgets -- buttons, sliders, static
text and Combobox.


There are many more widgets which pop up when you select some of
the program options. 

Abcm2psSettingsFrame (Dialog) (ABC Settings)
ErrorFrame (Dialog)
IncipitsFrame (Dialog)
MidiSettingsFrame (Dialog)
MidiOptionsFrame (Dialog)
NewTuneFrame (Dialog)
PageSetupDialog (Dialog)

ProgressFrame (Gauge)
TextEntryDialog (for Sort tunes and Renumber X:fields)

AboutFrame (html Dialog)



Classes in easy_abc.py
----------------------

MainFrame is the largest class consisting of more than 3000 lines of
code and making the bulk of easy_abc.py. It contains numerous
methods and subclasses. MainFrame setups up the user interface of
Easyabc and contains many of the event handlers. To create the
main page it calls up setup_menus(), setup_toolbar(), tune_list,
editor, music_pane and lays them out. Events are bound to various
methods in this class. It creates 3 objects which are vital components
of the program. tune_list is a clone of ListCtrl which is used to
provide direct access to any tune in the abc file. editor  is a
clone of the StyledTextCtrl and is used as the main editor of
the tune in abc notation. music_pane is a clone of MusicScorePanel
which is defined in the module music_score_panel.py.

There are about 20 classes defined in easy_abc.py such as AboutFrame(),
ErrorFrame(), FlexibleListCtrl(), and etc. Some of these may be
described as this guide is written.


MusicUpdateThread. Any time a single note is changed, inserted or
deleted in the editor, the music score panel is completely regenerated.
EasyAbc runs a separate thread to perform this process in parallel
without slowing down the user interface. The class MusicUpdateThread
is used to create an object music_update_thread which runs as a
separate task. The action of this task to run AbcToSvg is specified
in the method called 'run'. The thread is started with EasyAbc and
is aborted when EasyAbc closes.



Core Description
----------------

The core functions of EasyAbc are loading an abc file into the
editor, creating a table of contents in the listbox, displaying
the music score, and creating and playing the corresponding MIDI
file. A description of how this is done is given here.

The menu item File/Open is bound to the MainFrame method
called OnOpen. OnOpen creates an instance of the class wxFileDialog (which
is part of wxPython) and calls it dlg. dlg is displayed and
allows the user to browse to the path of the desired abc file
and referenced by dlg.GetPath(). OnOpen will first create a new frame
if another abc file is already loaded; otherwise it will
immediately call MainFrame.load() which reads the entire abc file
as a long string and puts it into the MainFrame.editor
StyledTextControl -stc), using the stc method SetText().
The StyledTextControl class is a powerful text editor which was
imported into separately by the statement 'import wx.stc as stc'.
This editor allows one to colourize different lexical components
of the ABC language. The MainFrame.editor was created by MainFrame
when the frame object was instantiated.  Finally MainFrame.load()
call the methods UpdateTuneList to populate the listbox tune_list
and then tune_list.Select(0) to select the first tune in the
list.


The method MainFrame.UpdateTuneList() calls MainFrame.GetTunes()
which creates an index called 'tunes' by going through the contents
of MainFrame.editor line by line and picking out the reference number,
title, rhythm, and current start line of the tune. This information
is stored in nested lists called self.tunes. The index self.tunes
is used to create a Python dictionary called tune_list.itemDataMap.
UpdateTuneList() loads the contents of the list into the listbox tune_list.


When you click on a tune in the TuneList, EasyAbc automatically scrolls
the editor to the abc transcription of that tune and displays the 
sheet music in the frame above. Updating the editor is fairly simple
however posting the new music score is rather complicated and
involves communicating with another thread.

When you click on a tune in the TuneList, an event EVT_LIST_ITEM_SELECTED
which is bound to OnTuneSelected is posted. OnTuneSelected grabs the
selected tune = self.GetSelectedTune() and sends it to the
music_update_thread using the method ConvertAbcToSvg. It gets the
scroll position of the tune LineFromPosition(tune.offset_start)
and scrolls the editor to that position.

The updating of the music panel involves converting the selected
abc tune into a SVG file using an external program abcm2ps. The
SVG file is then interpreted by another module svgrenderer which
redraws the entire score in the music panel.

The function AbcToSvg creates the SVG file from the abc representation. 
It first checks whether the SVG file is up to date and cached away
somewhere. The SVG file has a name generated by hashing the contents
of the tune. The placement of this cached file, if it exists depends
upon the operating system you are running; however, you can find
out the directory where it is cached when you click on the top
menu item Settings/Clear cache. It is a good idea to do this
occasionally. If the cached file is not found, then AbcToSvg
calls on abcm2ps to generate a new SVG file. The description
on how the SVG file is processed is deferred presently.


PlayMidi is the main gateway to converting the abc notated tune
to a MIDI file and sending it to the media player. GetAbcToPlay is
called to extract the tune from the editor. (The function provides
an option of playing only selected notes.)  PlayMidi provides an
option to remove all repeat indications from the abc representation.
The function AbcToMidi converts the tune to midi_file which is loaded
into the media player called mc by do_load_media_file.

AbcToMidi adds %%MIDI commands if needed and cleans up any issues that
may be a problem for abc2midi. Like AbcToSvg the MIDI files are stashed
away in a cache. If the MIDI file is not found in the cache,  Abc2midi
is called as a subprocess using the subprocess.Popen and
subprocess.communicate functions. This is the recommended method
of interacting with other programs in the operating system.

Depending on the operating system, the media player is either
DIRECTSHOW (Windows) or QUICKTIME (OS or OSX). This is set during
the initialization of the MainFrame. The media player allows
changing the tempo using the message mc.PlaybackRate.


The EasyAbc editor allows the user to select notes directly from
the music score panel and see them highlighted in the editor.
Similarly, the user can select notes in the editor and see them
highlighted in the music score panel. This is done by means
of a translation table called renderer.notes which is generated
by the method SvgRenderer.draw_svg_element in the module svgrenderer.
For each drawable element, the method appends (x, y, line, col, desc)
where x and y are the coordinates of where the element is drawn and
line and col are the line and column number of the element in the
abc transcription. desc is a descriptor of the element. Depending
on the direction you are going the closest note is found by either
matching the x,y coordinates or the line, col coordinates of the
note.

Svgrenderer extracts this information from the input svg file
that was created by abcm2ps. Normally abcm2sp does not include
this information, but there is an undocumented option -A which
instructs abcm2ps to add this information as a comment in either
the output PostScript or Scaleable Vector Graphics file that
it produces.


When you click on a note in the music score panel, the event EVT_LEFT_DOWN
is posted and calls the method MusicScorePanel.OnLeftButtonDown in the
module music_score_panel.py. The x,y coordinates of the mouse pointer
is obtained from the method get_xy_of_mouse_event() which compensates for
the zoom factor. The note index is obtained from the SvgElement.hit_test(x,y)
in the module svgrender.py which scans the list SvgElement.notes. 
add_note_to_selection adds this index to the selection,  the music
score panel is redrawn, and the selected note is highlighted. Finally
OnNoteSelectionChangedDesc is called.

When you click on a note in the editor, the event EVT_LEFT_UP is posted
which is bound to OnEditorMouseRelease. OnEditorMouseRelease calls
ScrollMusicPaneToMatchEditor to look for the closest note in the
music score panel using the renderer.notes  list. When the note
is found, the music score panel is redrawn.

Nils likes to implement some operations in a complicated way. When the
user selects a specific tune from the list of titles, OnTuneSelected()
is called which eventually causes the editor and music pane to be
updated. In order to update the music pane, it is necessary to convert
the abc tune into an svg file so it can be rendered on the screen. The
conversion is done by the function AbcToSvg, however, easy_abc.py
performs this using a thread that runs concurrently with the
EasyAbc interface. This thread may cause some problems on
some computers which are slow or do not have sufficient memory.

The main program starts up a separate thread called self.music_update_thread
which is an object of the class MusicUpdateThread(). This thread runs
in the background over the time span of the program EasyAbc. The
sole purpose of this thread is to compute the svg file from the
abc tune. This allows the EasyAbc interface to run while the
svg file is computed in the background. If you are just displaying
a single tune, then whether the conversion is done as a separate
thread or executed in EasyAbc is not important. On the other hand,
if you are displaying a large bunch of tunes then AbcToSvg may
be very busy and the EasyAbc interface may be unresponsive
during that time. However, I have not figured out how to select
a bunch of titles from the titles list box.

Computing the svg file through this thread requires some complex
signalling. First we need to tell the thread that we have new
data to be processed by setting the flag self.request_exists from
False to True. This is done by the method ConvertAbcToSvg which
also passes the abc tune and header to the thread. Though the
thread is 'sleeping' most of the time, it is still running and
checks self.request_exists 20 times a second. As soon as
self.request_exists is set to True the thread goes to work
(see the run method in the class OnMusicUpdate). It verifies that
there exists a K: field in the tune and executes the function
AbcToSvg(). When AbcToSvg completes it posts a custom event
message returning the names of the svg_files and any error messages
in the event handler. After that the thread becomes dormant
and waits again for the next self.request_exits.

MusicUpdateDoneEvent which eventually posts a customized event named
EVT_MUSIC_UPDATE_DONE which is bound to the handler
self.OnMusicUpdateDone. Self.OnMusicUpdateDone grabs the names
of the svg files and error messages and calls self.UpdateMusicPane.
Self.UpdateMusicPane eventually calls self.music_pane.set_svg with
one of the svg files to display.

What can go wrong? Unless the thread is running in a separate
processor they are actually not running concurrently; instead
the processor is switching rapidly between the thread and the
program many times per second. If the computer is slow and
does not have sufficient memory, the delays could cause some
synchronization problems. Two tasks may be trying to use the
same resource at the same time. WxPython may not handle this
correctly.

 
EasyAbc saves your settings using a method called save_settings() to
a file called settings1.3.dat whenever you make changes. The file
is found in a directory close to where the cache is kept for
svg and midi files. You can locate this when you clear out your cache
using the menu item settings/Clear cache.
