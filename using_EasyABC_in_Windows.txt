Python 2 is no longer supported (EasyABC 1.3.8 was the last version that supports Python 2)

You can download Python 3.8 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/

To start 'python' and 'pip' easily both executable should be in the PATH variable. For example:

set path=C:\Python38;C:\Python38\Scripts;%path%
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Python38\Lib

Python has a package installer called pip. It is located in the Scripts-folder (C:\Python38\Scripts)

pip install -U pyparsing
pip install -U pygame
pip install -U pywin32
from an elevated command prompt (run as administrator):
    python.exe Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install

pip install -U wxPython

(If that does not work: Download .whl file from https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/#files and run
pip install "C:\Downloads\wxPython-4.1.1-cp38-cp38-win32.whl"
)

Now EasyABC can be started using:
python easy_abc.py

Alternatively you can start easy_abc.py from a Python IDE which
should set the path automatically.

When dashed barlines (.|) are displayed as normal barlines then try:
pip install wxPython==4.0.7.post2
