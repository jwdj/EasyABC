To get easy_abc.py running on Windows you need to have Python 2.7.10,
and wxPython3.0-win32-3.0.2.0-py27 installed on your system.

You can download Python 2.7 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/
and wxPython from
http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#msw
or more specific
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0/wxPython3.0-win32-3.0.2.0-py27.exe/download

In addition you need to install pyparsing-2.0.1-win32-py2.7 and
pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20221/pywin32-221.win32-py2.7.exe/download

Python has a package installer called pip. It is located in the Scripts-folder (C:\Python27\Scripts)
But don't use it to install wxPython or pywin32.

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pygame
pip install pyparsing

If you are running easy_abc.py from a DOS command window, you
should first execute an autoexec.bat file which contains

set path=%path%;C:\python27;C:\python27\Scripts
set PYTHONPATH=C:\python27\Lib

You need to run the autoexec.bat each time you start up a DOS
command window.

Alternatively you can start easy_abc.py from a Python IDE which
should set the path automatically.

As of EasyABC 1.3.7.4 it is also possible to use Python 3.
The most features are working with the Python 3 version, but uploading tunes (Swedish only) is not possible because the mechanize package is still not ported to Python 3.

You can download Python 3.7 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/

set path=C:\Python37;C:\Python37\Scripts;%path%
set PYTHONPATH=C:\Python37\Lib

Python has a package installer called pip. It is located in the Scripts-folder (C:\Python37\Scripts)

pip install pyparsing
pip install pygame
pip install pywin32
from an elevated command prompt (run as administrator):
    python.exe Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install 

Download .whl file from https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/#files
pip install "D:\Downloads\wxPython-4.0.6-cp37-cp37m-win32.whl"

Now EasyABC can be started using:
python easy_abc.py
