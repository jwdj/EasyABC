This note describes how to create a Windows PC executable of easy_abc.py

EasyABC comes with setup.py to create easy_abc.exe and setupEasyABC.iss to create an installer.
You first need to be able to run easy_abc.py using Python.
See using_EasyABC_in_Windows.txt for that.

Then you will also need to install on your computer the program Inno Setup 6 and the python package cx_Freeze:
Inno Setup 6 can be downloaded here: https://jrsoftware.org/

And cx_Freeze can be installed using:
python -m pip install --upgrade cx_Freeze

Copy all the executables, abc2abc.exe, abc2midi.exe, abcm2ps.exe,
nwc2xml.exe, and zlibwapi.dll into the bin folder. You can find nwc2xml.exe
and zlibwapi.dll in the older easy_abc install.

Make sure the environment variables PYTHON and PYTHONPATH are set correctly.

Open a command window, go to the folder easyabc_source_code... and set the
PYTHON and PYTHONPATH using the autoexec.bat file.  You should now be
ready to run:

build.bat

You should see lots of messages and an executable with other files
should be put into the folder build/exe.win32-38/

I found that executable runs fine on Windows 7 64-bit but,
I did not get it to run on my Windows XP laptop.
